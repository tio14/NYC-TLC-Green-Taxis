**The New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC)**, created in 1971, is the agency responsible 
**for licensing and regulating** New York City's medallion (yellow) taxis, street hail livery (green) taxis, 
for-hire vehicles (FHVs), commuter vans, and paratransit vehicles. The TLC collects trip record 
information for each taxi and for-hire vehicle trip completed by their licensed drivers and vehicles. 
They receive taxi trip data from the technology service providers (TSPs) that provide electronic 
metering in each cab, and FHV trip data from the app, community livery, black car, or luxury 
limousine company, or base, who dispatched the trip. In each trip record dataset, one row represents a single trip made by a TLC-licensed vehicle.
