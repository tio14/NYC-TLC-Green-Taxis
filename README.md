**The New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC)**, created in 1971, is the agency responsible **for licensing and regulating** New York City's medallion (yellow) taxis, street hail livery (green) taxis, for-hire vehicles (FHVs), commuter vans, and paratransit vehicles. The TLC collects trip record information for each taxi and for-hire vehicle trip completed by their licensed drivers and vehicles. They receive taxi trip data from the technology service providers (TSPs) that provide electronic metering in each cab, and FHV trip data from the app, community livery, black car, or luxury limousine company, or base, who dispatched the trip. In each trip record dataset, one row represents a single trip made by a TLC-licensed vehicle.

**Green taxis**, also known as **boro taxis** and **street-hail liveries**, were introduced in August of 2013 **to improve taxi service and availability in the boroughs**. Green taxis may respond to street hails, but only in the areas indicated in green on the map (i.e. above W 110 St/E 96th St in Manhattan and in the boroughs). They cannot pick up passengers at airports unless the trips are pre-arranged through a base. SHLs are inspected twice per year, and drivers must pass a driver education course. Fares are set by the TLC on street hails and e-hails. the dispatching base sets the fare when service is pre-arranged.

In this scenario, **we will focus on this type of taxis (green).**
